The project focuses on creating an automated tool for melanoma detection using machine learning applied to skin lesion images. Motivated by the critical need for early melanoma identification to improve treatment outcomes, this initiative seeks to harness the power of image processing and artificial intelligence to distinguish between malignant and benign skin lesions accurately.[2]
The inference tasks are  -- image classification, feature analysis and model development.
